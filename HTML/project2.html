        <h1><u>DIWALI</u></h1><br>
        <p><i>Diwali is the festival of light,
             where every city , street and house where decorated by 
            lights and diya.we celebrate it buy doing puja of maa laxmi and ganesh ji
        in our house and also decorate the home with flowers and rangoli
    with playing cracker is the main jouful event of this occasion.</i></p><hr>
    <h3><s>||BURNING CRACKERS ALSO CREATE AIR POLLUTION FO SAY NO TO CRACKERS THIS

        <h1>THIRD EQUATION OF MOTION</h1>
<P>The third equation of motion describes the relationship between an object's final velocity, initial velocity, constant acceleration, and displacement. It is especially useful for solving problems where the time of motion is not known.</P>
<h5>The formula is:</h5>
    <p>v<sup>2</sup>=u<sup>2</sup>+2as</p>
<pre>Where:
    (v) = final velocity
    (u) = initial velocity
    (a) = constant acceleration
    (s) = displacement (distance covered)</pre>
<p>Example applicationImagine a car starting from rest and accelerating at 2 m/s² for a distance of 100 meters. To find its final velocity (\(v\)), you would use the third equation of motion.</p>
<pre>Initial velocity (u): The car starts from rest, so \(u=0\) m/s.
    Acceleration (a): \(a=2\) m/s².
    Displacement (s): \(s=100\) m.</pre>
<p>By substituting these values into the equation:</p>
<pre>       v<sup>2</sup>=0<sup>2</sup>+2(2)(100)
               v<sup>2</sup>=400
               v=&radic;400
v=20m/s</pre>
<h4>The final velocity of the car is 20 m/s.</h4>
